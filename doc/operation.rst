Installation and Operation
==========================

System requirements
-------------------
For basic operation (such as for development or proof-of-concept) the only
hardware requirement is an NVIDIA GPU with tensor cores. The rest of this
section describes recommended setup for high-performance operation.

Networking
^^^^^^^^^^
An NVIDIA NIC (ConnectX or Bluefield) should be used, as katgpucbf can bypass
the kernel networking stack when using one of these NICs. See the spead2
:external+spead2:doc:`documentation <py-ibverbs>` for details on setting up and
tuning the ibverbs support. Pay particular attention to disabling multicast
loopback.

The correlator uses multicast packets to communicate between the individual
engines. Your network needs to be set up to handle multicast, and to do so
efficiently (i.e., not falling back to broadcasting). Note that the
out-of-the-box configuration for Spectrum switches running Onyx allocates very
little buffer space to multicast traffic, which can easily lead to lost
packets. Refer to the manual for your switch to adjust the buffer allocations.

The engines also default to using large packets (8 KiB of payload, plus some
headers), so your network needs to be configured to support jumbo frames. While
there are command-line options to reduce the packet sizes, this will
significantly reduce performance.

BIOS settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
See the system tuning guidance in the :external+spead2:doc:`spead2
documentation <perf>`. In particular, we've found that when running multiple
F-engines per host on an AMD Epyc (Milan) system, we get best performance with

- NPS1 setting for NUMA per socket (NPS2 might work too, but NPS4 tends to
  cause sporadic lost packets);
- the GPU and the NIC in slots attached to different host bridges.

Installation
------------

Installation with Docker
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The recommended way to use katgpucbf is via Docker. There is currently no
published Docker image, so it is necessary to build your own. To do so, change
to the root directory of the repository and run

.. code:: sh

   DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --ssh default -t NAME .

where :samp:`{NAME}` is the name to assign to the image.

.. todo:: Document how to get private access to vkgdr, or just open it up

You will need to have the NVIDIA container runtime installed to provide Docker
with access to the GPU.

Installation with pip
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
It is also possible to install katgpucbf with pip. In this case, you will need
to have CUDA already installed. Change to the root directory of the repository
and run

.. code:: sh

   pip install ".[gpu]"

Note that if you are planning to do development on katgpucbf, you should refer
to the :doc:`Developers' guide <dev-guide>`.


Controlling the Correlator
--------------------------

.. todo::

    If this section gets too much, it can possibly make its way into its own
    ``controlling.rst`` file or some such.

katsdpcontroller
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. todo::  ``NGC-683``
    Describe katsdpcontroller, its role, note that the module can be used
    without it and whatever is used in its place will need to implement the
    functionality described in this "chapter".

    Important to note is that we try to make interacting with katsdpcontroller
    as similar as possible compared to interacting with the individual engines,
    for ease of understanding.


Starting the correlator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. todo::  ``NGC-684``
    Describe how a correlator should be started. Master controller figures out
    based on a set of input parameters, how to invoke a few instances of
    katgpucbf as dsim, fgpu or xbgpu.


Controlling the correlator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. todo::  ``NGC-685``
    Describe how the correlator is controlled. This will mostly be delays and
    gains. Product controller passes almost identical requests on to relevant
    instances of katgpucbf.


Shutting down the correlator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. todo::  ``NGC-686``
    Describe how to shut the correlator down. Product or master controller
    passes requests on to individual running instances.

Monitoring
^^^^^^^^^^

.. todo:: ``NGC-687``

    - Describe KATCP sensors.
    - Describe Prometheus monitoring capabilities.
    - Probably also a good idea to mention the general logic distinguishing
      between what goes to katcp and what to prometheus.


Data Interfaces
---------------

.. todo::

    If this section gets to be too large, it can probably also make its way into
    its own file.

.. _spead-protocol:

SPEAD protocol
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Streaming Protocol for Exchanging Astronomical Data (`SPEAD`_) is a
lightweight streaming protocol, primarily UDP-based, designed for components
of a radio astronomy signal-chain to transmit data to each other over Ethernet
links.

.. _SPEAD: https://spead2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_downloads/6160ba1748b1812337d9c7766bdf747a/SPEAD_Protocol_Rev1_2012.pdf

The SPEAD implementation used in :mod:`katgpucbf` is :mod:`spead2`. It is highly
recommended that consumers of :mod:`katgpucbf` output data also make use of
:mod:`spead2`. For those who cannot, this document serves as a brief summary
of the SPEAD protocol in order to understand the output of each application
within :mod:`katgpucbf`, which are further detailed elsewhere.

SPEAD transmits logical collections of data known as :dfn:`heaps`. A heap
consists of one or more UDP packets. A SPEAD transmitter will decompose a heap
into packets and the receiver will collect all the packets and reassemble the
heap.


Packet Format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A number of metadata fields are included within each packet, to facilitate heap
reassembly. The SPEAD flavour used in :mod:`katgpucbf` is 64-48, which means that
each metadata field is 64 bits wide, with the first bit indicating the address
mode, the next 15 carrying the item ID and the remaining 48 carrying the value
(in the case of immediate items).

Each packet contains the following metadata fields:

``header``
  Contains information about the flavour of SPEAD being used.

``heap counter/id``
  A unique identifier for each new heap.

``heap size``
  Size of the heap in bytes.

``heap offset``
  Address in bytes indicating the current packet's location within the heap.

``payload size``
  Number of bytes within the current packet payload.


Each SPEAD stream will have additional 64-bit fields specific to itself,
referred to in SPEAD nomenclature as :dfn:`immediate items`. Each packet
transmitted will contain all the immediate items to assist third-party consumers
that prefer to work at the packet level (see
:attr:`spead2.send.Heap.repeat_pointers` â€” note that this is not default spead2
behaviour, but it is always enabled in katgpucbf).

Most of the metadata remains constant for all packets in a heap. The heap offset
changes across packets, in multiples of the packet size (which is configurable
at runtime). This is used by the receiver to reassemble packets into a full heap.

The values contained in the immediate items may change from heap to heap, or
they may be static, with the data payload being the only changing thing,
depending on the nature of the stream.

.. todo::  ``NGC-676``
    Consolidate ``fgpu.networking`` and ``xbgpu.networking`` (i.e. input and
    output packet format sections) here.

F-Engine Data Format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Input
""""""
The F-engine receives dual-polarisation input from a digitiser (raw antenna)
stream. In MeerKAT and MeerKAT Extension, each polarisation's raw digitiser data
is distributed over eight contiguous multicast addresses, to facilitate load-
balancing on the network, but the receiver is flexible enough to accept input
from more or fewer multicast addresses.

The only immediate item in the digitiser's output heap used by the F-engine is
the ``timestamp``.


Output Heap Payload
"""""""""""""""""""

In the case of an 8192-channel array with 64 X-engines, each heap contains 8192/64 =
128 channels. By default, there are 256 time samples per channel. Each sample is
dual-pol complex 8-bit data for a combined sample width of 32 bits or 4 bytes.

The heap payload size in this example is equal to

    channels_per_heap * samples_per_channel * complex_sample_size = 128 * 256 * 4 = 131,072 = 128 KiB.

The payload size defaults to a power of 2, so that packet boundaries in a heap
align with channel boundaries. This isn't important for the :mod:`spead2`
receiver used in the X-engine, but it may be useful for potential third party
consumers of F-engine data.

Output Packet Format
"""""""""""""""""""""

According to the **MeerKAT M1000-0001 CBF-Data Subscribers ICD (M1200-0001-020)**,
the Channelised Voltage Data SPEAD packets have the following data format:

.. figure:: images/feng_spead_heap_format_table.png

  SPEAD packet format output by an F-Engine

The F-engines in an array each transmit a subset of frequency channels to each
X-engine, with each X-engine receiving from a single multicast group. F-engines
therefore need to ensure that their heap IDs do not collide.

The immediate items specific to the F-engine output stream are as follows:

``timestamp``
  (See above table)


``feng_id``
  (See above table)
  The X-engine uses this field to distinguish data received from multiple
  F-engines.

``frequency`` (See above table)
  Although each packet may represent a different frequency, this value remains
  constant across a heap and represents only the first frequency channel in the
  range of channels within the heap. The X-engine does not strictly need this
  information.

``feng_raw item pointer`` (See above table)
  .. comment just to get this formatted as definition list


X-Engine Data Format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Input Data Format
""""""""""""""""""
The X-Engine receives antenna channelised data from the output of the F-engines,
as discussed above. Each X-Engine receives data from each F-engine, but only
from a subset of the channels. Thus the multicast address subscribed to by the
X-Engine's input stream has a many-to-one relationship.

Output Heap Payload
"""""""""""""""""""

Each correlation product contains a real and imaginary sample (both 32-bit
integer) for a combined size of 8 bytes per baseline. The ordering of the
correlation products is given in the :samp:`{xeng-stream-name}-bls-ordering`
sensor in the product controller, but can be calculated deterministically:
:func:`~katgpucbf.xbgpu.correlation.get_baseline_index` indicates the ordering
of the baselines, and the four individual correlation products are always
ordered ``aa, ba, ab, bb``, where `a` and `b` can either be vertical or
horizontal polarisation (``v`` or ``h``), depending on the configuration of the
instrument.

All the baselines for a single channel are grouped together contiguously in the
heap, and each X-engine correlates a contiguous subset of the entire spectrum.
For example, in an 80-antenna, 8192-channel array with 64 X-engines, each X-engine output
heap contains 8192/64 = 128 channels.

The heap payload size in this example is equal to

  channels_per_heap * correlation_products * complex_sample_size = 128 * 12960 * 8 = 13,271,040 bytes or 12.656 MiB.


Output Packet Format
"""""""""""""""""""""

According to the **MeerKAT M1000-0001 CBF-Data Subscribers ICD (M1200-0001-020)**,
the Baseline Correlation Products SPEAD packets have the following data format:

.. figure:: images/xeng_spead_heap_format_table.png

  SPEAD packet format output by an X-Engine

In MeerKAT Extension, four correlation products are computed for each baseline,
namely vv, hv, vh, and hh. Thus, for an 80-antenna correlator, there are
:math:`\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 3240` baselines, and 12960 correlation products. The
parameter ``n-bls`` in the above table refers to the latter figure.

The immediate items specific to the X-engine output stream are as follows:

``frequency`` (See above table)
  Although each packet represents a different frequency,
  this value remains constant across a heap and represents
  only the first frequency channel in the range of
  channels within the heap.

``timestamp`` (See above table)
  .. comment just to get this formatted as definition list

``xeng_raw item pointer`` (See above table)
  .. comment just to get this formatted as definition list

Each X-engine sends data to its own multicast group. A receiver can combine data
from several multicast groups to consume a wider spectrum, using the
``frequency`` item to place each heap. To facilitate this, X-engine output heap
IDs are kept unique across all X-engines in an array.
