F-Engine Design
===============
A somewhat higher-level view of the design can be found in [Merry2023]_.
The paper is based on an earlier version of this code (which pre-dates the
narrowband support, for example).

.. [Merry2023] Bruce Merry, "Efficient channelization on a graphics processing
   unit," J. Astron. Telesc. Instrum. Syst. 9(3) 038001 (12 July 2023).
   https://doi.org/10.1117/1.JATIS.9.3.038001

We start by describing the design for wideband output. Narrowband outputs
use most of the same components, but have extra complications, which are
described in a :ref:`separate section <fgpu.narrow>`.

Network receive
---------------
The data from both polarisations are received by a single stream group, and
polarisation forms the major axis of each chunk. The stream group may comprise
multiple streams to support receive bandwidths that cannot be handled by a
single thread. The polarisation of each packet is identified by a flag in the
SPEAD items of the packet, rather than by the network interface or multicast
group it was directed to.

To minimise the number of copies, chunks are initialised with CUDA pinned memory
(host memory that can be efficiently copied to the GPU).  Alternatively, it is
possible to use `vkgdr`_ to have the CPU write directly to GPU memory while
assembling the chunk. This is not enabled by default because it is not always
possible to use more than 256 MiB of the GPU memory for this, which can severely
limit the chunk size.

GPU Processing
--------------
The actual GPU kernels are reasonably straight-forward, because they're
generally memory-bound rather than compute-bound. The main challenges are in
data movement through the system.

Decode
^^^^^^
Digitiser samples are bit-packed integers. While it is possible to
write a dedicated kernel for decoding that makes efficient accesses to memory
(using contiguous word-size loads), it is faster overall to do the decoding as
part of the PFB filter because it avoids a round trip to memory. For the
PFB, the decode is done in a very simple manner:

 1. Determine the two bytes that hold the sample.
 2. Load them and combine them into a 16-bit value.
 3. Shift left to place the desired bits in the high bits.
 4. Shift right to sign extend.
 5. Convert to float.

While many bytes get loaded twice (because they hold bits from two samples),
the cache is able to prevent this affecting DRAM bandwidth.

For the above to work, every sample needs to be entirely contained within two
bytes. This will be the case for up to 10 bits, as well as for 12- or 16-bit
samples, and hence these are the values supported. For 3-, 5-, 6- and 7-bit
samples, the sample will sometimes but not always be contained in a single
byte; in these cases an extraneous byte is loaded. This could be the byte
following the end of the buffer; to handle this, a padding byte is added to
avoid illegal memory accesses. For 2-, 4- and 8-bit samples, the value will
always be contained in a single byte, and a simplified code path is used in
these cases.

The narrowband digital down conversion also decodes the packed samples, but
this is discussed :ref:`separately <ddc>`.

Polyphase Filter Bank
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The polyphase filter bank starts with a finite impulse response (FIR) filter,
with some number of *taps* (e.g., 16), and a *step* size which is twice the
number of output channels. This can be thought of as organising the samples as
a 2D array, with *step* columns, and then applying a FIR down each column.
Since the columns are independent, we map each column to a separate workitem,
which keeps a sliding window of samples in its registers. GPUs generally don't
allow indirect indexing of registers, so loop unrolling (by the number of
taps) is used to ensure that the indices are known at compile time.

This might not give enough parallelism, particularly for small channel counts,
so in fact each column in split into sections and a separate workitem is used
for each section. There is a trade-off here as samples at the boundaries
between sections need to be loaded by both workitems, leading to overheads.

Registers are used to hold both the sliding window and the weights, which
leads to significant register pressure. This reduces occupancy and leads to
reduced performance, but it is still good for up to 16 taps. For higher tap
counts it would be necessary to redesign the kernel.

The weights are passed into the kernel as a table, rather than computed on the
fly. While it may be possible to compute weights on the fly, using single
precision in the computation would reduce the accuracy. Instead, we compute
weights once on the host in double precision and then convert them to
single precision.

A single FIR may also need to cross the boundary between chunks. To handle
this, we allocate sufficient space at the end of each chunk for the PFB
footprint, and copy the start of the next chunk to the end of the current one.
Note that this adds an extra chunk worth of latency to the process.

.. _fgpu-fft:

FFT
^^^
After the FIR above, we can perform the FFT, which is done with cuFFT. The
built-in support for doing multiple FFTs at once means that it can saturate
the GPU even with small channel counts.

Na√Øvely using cuFFT for the full real-to-complex transformation can be quite
slow and require multiple passes over the memory, because

1. There is a maximum number of channels that cuFFT can handle in one pass (it
   depends on the GPU, but seems to be 16384 for a GeForce RTX 3080 Ti).
   Larger transforms require at least one more pass.

2. It appears to handle real-to-complex transforms by first doing a
   complex-to-complex transform and then using an additional pass to fix up
   the result (i.e. form final FFT output).

For performance reasons, we move part of the Fourier Transform into the
post-processing kernel, and also handle fixing up the real-to-complex transformation.
This is achieved by decomposing the transformation into separately-computed smaller parts
(using the Cooley-Tukey algorithm). Part of the Fourier transform is computed using
cuFFT and the final stage (post-processing kernel) of the process includes one round of
Cooley-Tukey computation and the computation to form the real-to-complex transformation.

To start, let's consider the traditional equation for the Fourier Transform. Let :math:`N`
be the number of channels into which we wish to decompose the input sequence, and let
:math:`x_i` be the (real) time-domain samples (:math:`0 \le i < 2N`) and :math:`X_k` be its discrete
Fourier transform (DFT). Because the time domain is real, the frequency domain is Hermitian symmetric,
and we only need to compute half of it to recover all the information. We thus only need to consider
:math:`k` from :math:`0` to :math:`N-1` (this loses information about :math:`X_N`, but it is convenient
to discard it and thus have a power-of-two number of outputs).

.. math:: X_k = \sum_{i=0}^{2N-1} e^{\frac{-2\pi j}{2N}\cdot ik} x_i.

We know that a direct implementation of the DFT is inefficient and alternative, more efficient
means exist to perform this computation. One such method is the FFT introduced by Cooley-Tukey
and in the GPU space cuFFT is one such implementation. As highlighted earlier, transform sizes
of greater than 16384 (for a GeForce RTX 3080 Ti at least) require more than one memory pass making it
less efficient than it needs to be. The technique detailed below uses the decomposition as provided by
Cooley-Tukey to break down a larger transform into smaller 'sub-transforms' where the number of 'sub-transforms'
is intentionally kept small for efficiency reasons and later combined (same process as the FFT) to form
the larger transform size. This is a multi-step process and requires some extra notation and math tricks.

Real-to-complex transform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now for some notation to see how this works. We start by treating :math:`x` (a real array of length 2N) as if it is
a complex array :math:`z` of length N, with each adjacent pair of real values in :math:`x` interpreted as the
real and imaginary components of a complex value, and computing the Fourier transform of :math:`z`. Formally,
let :math:`u_i = x_{2i}` and :math:`v_i = x_{2i+1}`. Then :math:`z_i = u_i + jv_i = x_{2i} + j x_{2i+1}`.

We will start by computing the Fourier transform of :math:`z`. Let :math:`U`, :math:`V` and :math:`Z` denote the
Fourier transforms of :math:`u`, :math:`v` and :math:`z` respectively. Since the Fourier transform is a linear
operator and we defined :math:`z = u + jv`, we also have :math:`Z = U + jV`.

It is important to remember that both :math:`u` and :math:`v` are real-valued, so :math:`U`
and :math:`V` are Hermitian symmetric. By re-arranging things we can reconstruct :math:`U` and
:math:`V` from :math:`Z` using Hermitian symmetry properties. Let :math:`U'`
be :math:`U` with reversed indices i.e., :math:`U'_k = U_{-k}` where indices are taken
modulo :math:`N`.

Hermitian symmetry means that :math:`U'_k = U_{-k} = \overline{U_k}` where
the 'overline' in :math:`\overline{U_k}` denotes conjugation. This is effectively saying that by taking the
reverse indices in :math:`U_k` we get a conjugated result (see [#]_ for a reminder of why this is the case).

Looking back at :math:`U` and :math:`V` components, :math:`U' = \overline{U}` and similarly :math:`V' = \overline{V}`.
Why is this important? Previously we stated that :math:`Z = U + jV`. Now we can consider the reverse of :math:`Z`,
namely :math:`Z'`.

.. math::
   Z'              &= U' + jV'\\
   \overline{Z'}   &= \overline{U' + jV'}\\
                   &= \overline{U'} + \overline{j}\overline{V'}\\
                   &= U - jV\\

What we actually want is to be able to separate out :math:`U` and :math:`jV` in terms of only :math:`Z`
and :math:`Z'` (remember, :math:`z` is the input array of real-valued samples reinterpreted as if it is
an array of N complex samples).

Now let's formulate both :math:`U` and :math:`V` in terms of :math:`Z` and :math:`\overline{Z'}`.

.. math::
      Z + \overline{Z'} &= (U + jV) + (U - jV)\\
                        &= 2U +j(V-V)\\
                        &= 2U.

Likewise,

.. math::
      Z - \overline{Z'} &= (U + jV) - (U - jV)\\
                        &= 2jV.


Using the above we can see that :math:`U = \frac{Z + \overline{Z'}}{2}` and similarly
:math:`V = \frac{Z - \overline{Z'}}{2j}`. Next, we use the Cooley-Tukey
transform to construct :math:`X` from :math:`U` and :math:`V`. To do this let's go back to
the initial definition of the DFT and expand that using the Cooley-Tukey approach.

.. math::

   X_k &= \sum_{i=0}^{2N-1} e^{\frac{-2\pi j}{2N}\cdot ik} x_i\\
       &= \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} e^{\frac{-2\pi j}{2N}\cdot 2ik} u_i +
          \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} e^{\frac{-2\pi j}{2N}\cdot (2i+1)k} v_i\\
       &= \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} e^{\frac{-2\pi j}{N}\cdot ik} u_i +
          e^{\frac{-\pi j}{N}\cdot k}\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} e^{\frac{-2\pi j}{N}\cdot ik} v_i\\
       &= U_k + e^{\frac{-\pi j}{N}\cdot k} V_k.\\

What we get is a means to compute the desired output :math:`X_{k}` using the :math:`U` and :math:`V`
which we compute from the complex-valued input data sequence :math:`z`.

We can also re-use some common expressions by computing :math:`X_{N-k}` at the same time

.. math::

   X_{N-k} &= U_{N-k} + e^{\frac{-\pi j}{N}\cdot (N-k)} V_{N-k}\\
           &= \overline{U_k} - \overline{e^{\frac{-\pi j}{N}\cdot k} V_k}.

This raises the question: Why compute both :math:`X_{k}` and :math:`X_{N-k}`? After all,
parameter :math:`k` should range the full channel range initially stated (parameter :math:`N`). The answer:
compute efficiency. It is costly to compute :math:`U_k` and :math:`V_k` so if we can use them to
compute two elements of :math:`X`` (:math:`X_{k}` and :math:`X_{N-k}`) at once it is better than producing
only one element of :math:`X`.

Why is doing all this work more efficient that letting cuFFT handle the
real-to-complex transformation? After all, cuFFT most likely does this (or
something equivalent) internally. The answer is that instead of using a
separate kernel for it (which would consume memory bandwidth), we built it
into the postprocessing kernel (see the next section).

Unzipping the FFT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Right --- lets get practical and show how we *actually* implement this. From here we'll assume all
transforms are complex-to-complex unless specified otherwise. Firstly, some recap: the Cooley-Tukey
algorithm allows a transform of size :math:`N = mn` to be decomposed into :math:`n` transforms of
size :math:`m` followed by :math:`m` transforms of size :math:`n`. We'll refer to :math:`n` as the
"unzipping factor". We will keep it small (typically not more than 4), as the
implementation requires registers proportional to this factor. We are now going to go step-by-step and
separate the input array :math:`z` into :math:`n` parts of size :math:`m` with each part operated on using a
Fourier transform.

To recap the indexing used in the Cooley-Tukey algorithm: let a
time-domain index :math:`i` be written as :math:`qn + r` and a frequency-domain index :math:`k` be
written as :math:`pm + s`. Let :math:`z^r` denote the array :math:`z_r, z_{n+r}, \dots, z_{(m-1)n+r}`,
and denote its Fourier transform by :math:`Z^r`. It is worthwhile to point out that the superscript
:math:`r` *does not* denote exponentiation but rather is a means to indicate an :math:`r^{th}` array.
In practice this :math:`r^{th}` array is a subset (part) of the larger :math:`z` array of input data.

As a way of an example, let :math:`n=4` ("unzipping factor") and :math:`N=32768` (total number of channels).
Now let's unpack this a bit further --- what is actually happening is that the initial array :math:`z` is divided into
:math:`n=4` separate arrays each of :math:`m=32768/4 = 8192` elements (hence the :math:`N = mn` above).
The actual samples that land up in each array are defined by the indices :math:`i` and :math:`k`.

Lets start with :math:`i`. It was stated that :math:`i = qn + r`. The parameter :math:`r` takes on the range :math:`0` to :math:`n-1`
(so :math:`r=0` to :math:`r=3` as :math:`n = 4`) and :math:`q` takes on the
range :math:`0` to :math:`m-1` (i.e. :math:`q=0` to :math:`q=8191`).
So we are dividing up array :math:`z` into :math:`n` smaller arrays denoted by  :math:`r` (i.e. :math:`z^{r}`)
each of length :math:`m=8192`. So what does this look like practically?

The first array when :math:`r=0` (i.e. :math:`z^{0}`)

========================   ========
   Inputs                  Index
------------------------   --------
  qn + r                      i
========================   ========
:math:`0 \cdot 4` + 0         0
:math:`1 \cdot 4` + 0         4
:math:`2 \cdot 4` + 0         8
...                           ...
...                           ...
:math:`8191 \cdot 4` + 0    32764
========================   ========

This can be extended to the other remaining arrays. The fourth array when :math:`r=3` (for example), :math:`z^{3}`
is :math:`z_{3}`, :math:`z_{7}`, :math:`z_{11}`, ..., :math:`z_{32767}`.

What this shows is that each sub-array consists of samples from the initial array :math:`z` indexed
by :math:`i=qn+r` where each sample is every :math:`4^{th}` and offset by :math:`r`. Pictorially
this looks like,

.. image:: images/z_array.png
   :width: 600

Right, so we have separate sub-arrays as indexed from the initial array, what happens next? These various
:math:`z^{r}` arrays are fed to cuFFT yielding :math:`n` complex-to-complex transforms. These separate transforms
now need to be combined to form a single real-to-complex transform of the full initial size. An inconvenience
of this structure is that :math:`z^r` is not a contiguous set of input samples, but a strided array.
While cuFFT does support both strided inputs and batched transformations, we cannot batch over :math:`r`
and over multiple spectra at the same time as it only supports a single batch dimension with corresponding
stride. We solve this by modifying the PFB kernel to reorder its output such that each :math:`z^r` is output
contiguously. This can be done by shuffling some bits in the output index (because we assume powers of two
everywhere).

To see how the :math:`k` indexing works :math:`k = pm + s` and is dealt with in a similar manner as above.
Parameter :math:`m = 8192` (in this example), and :math:`p` has a range :math:`0` to :math:`n-1`
(i.e. :math:`p = 0` to :math:`p = 3` as :math:`n = 4` in our example); and :math:`s` takes on the
range :math:`0` to :math:`m-1` (i.e. :math:`s = 0` to :math:`s = 8191`).

Looking at this practically,

When :math:`p = 0`

===========================  =========
   Inputs                     Index
---------------------------  ---------
  pm + s                      k
===========================  =========
:math:`0 \cdot 8192` + 0      0
:math:`0 \cdot 8192` + 1      1
:math:`0 \cdot 8192` + 2      2
...                           ...
...                           ...
:math:`0 \cdot 8192` + 8191   8191
===========================  =========

This too can be extended to the other remaining arrays.

Viewing the above tables it can be seen that the full range of outputs are indexed in batches of
:math:`m = 8192` outputs, *but*, this is not yet the final output and are merely the outputs as provided
by inputting the respective :math:`z^{r}` arrays into cuFFT (all we have done at this point is
computed :math:`Z^{r}` using cuFFT). As a useful flashback, we are aiming to compute :math:`Z_{k}` from :math:`z`
(made up from smaller arrays :math:`z^{r}`) with the intention of computing the :math:`U` and :math:`V`
terms. Why? So that with :math:`U` and :math:`V` we can compute :math:`X_{k}` which is our desired
final output.

The aim is to compute :math:`Z_k` so putting it more formally we have

.. math::

   Z_k = Z_{pm+s}
   &= \sum_{i=0}^{mn - 1} e^{\frac{-2\pi j}{mn}\cdot ik} z_i\\
   &= \sum_{q=0}^{m - 1}\sum_{r=0}^{n-1}
      e^{\frac{-2\pi j}{mn}(qn + r)(pm + s)} z_{qn + r}\\
   &= \sum_{r=0}^{n-1} e^{\frac{-2\pi j}{n}\cdot rp} \left[e^{\frac{-2\pi j}{mn}\cdot rs}
      \sum_{q=0}^{m-1} e^{\frac{-2\pi j}{m}\cdot qs} z^r_q\right]\\
   &= \sum_{r=0}^{n-1} e^{\frac{-2\pi j}{n}\cdot rp}
      \left[e^{\frac{-2\pi j}{mn}\cdot rs} Z^r_s\right].

The whole expression is a Fourier transform of the expression in brackets
(the exponential inside the bracket is the so-called "twiddle factor").

In the post-processing kernel, each work-item computes the results for a
single :math:`s` and for all :math:`p`. To compute the real-to-complex
transformation, it also needs to compute

.. math::

   \overline{Z_{-k}} = \overline{Z_{-pm - s}}
   = \sum_{r=0}^{n-1} e^{\frac{-2\pi j}{n}\cdot rp}
     \left[e^{\frac{-2\pi j}{mn}\cdot rs} \overline{Z^r_{-s}}\right].


Right, lets wrap things up. We have :math:`Z_{k}` (i.e. :math:`Z`)
and :math:`\overline{Z_{-k}}` (i.e. :math:`\overline{Z'}`) which is what we set
out to compute. This then means we can compute :math:`X_{k}` and :math:`X_{N-k}`
as stated earlier from :math:`U = \frac{Z + \overline{Z'}}{2}` and
:math:`V = \frac{Z - \overline{Z'}}{2j}` (with appropriate twiddle factor) to combine
the various outputs from cuFFT and get the final desired output :math:`X_k`.

We also wish to keep a tally of saturated (clipped) values, which requires
that each output value is considered exactly once. This is made more
complicated by the process that computes :math:`X_k` and :math:`X_{N-k}`
jointly. With :math:`k = pm + s`, we consider all :math:`0 \le p < n` and
:math:`0 \le s \le \frac{m}{2}`, and discard :math:`X_{N-k}` when :math:`s =
0` or :math:`s = \frac{m}{2}` as these are duplicated cases.

Postprocessing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The remaining steps are to

 1. Compute the real Fourier transform from several complex-to-complex
    transforms (see the previous section).
 2. Apply gains and fine delays.
 3. Do a partial transpose, so that *spectra-per-heap* spectra
    are stored contiguously for each channel (the Nyquist frequencies are also
    discarded at this point).
 4. Convert to integer.
 5. Where the output bits per sample is not a whole number of bytes, do the
    necessary bit-packing.
 6. Interleave the polarisations.

These are all combined into a single kernel to minimise memory traffic. The
katsdpsigproc package provides a template for transpositions, and the other
operations are all straightforward. While C++ doesn't have a convert with
saturation function, we can access the CUDA functionality through inline PTX
assembly (OpenCL C has an equivalent function).

Fine delays and the twiddle factor for the Cooley-Tukey transformation are
computed using the ``sincospi`` function, which saves both a multiplication by
:math:`\pi` and a range reduction.

The gains, fine delays and phases need to be made available to the kernel. We
found that transferring them through the usual CUDA copy mechanism leads to
sub-optimal scheduling, because these (small) transfers could end up queued
behind the much larger transfers of digitiser samples. Instead, we use `vkgdr`_
to allow the CPU to write directly to the GPU buffers. The buffers are
replicated per output item, so that it is possible for the CPU to be updating
the values for one output item while the GPU is computing on another.

Coarse delays
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
One of the more challenging aspects of the processing design was the handling
of delays. In the end we chose to exploit the fact that the expected delay
rates are very small, typically leading to at most one coarse delay change per
chunk. We thus break up each chunk into sections where the coarse delay is
constant for both polarisations.

Our approach is based on inverting the delay model: output timestamps are
regularly spaced, and for each output spectrum, determine the sample in the
input that will be delayed until that time (to the nearest sample). We then
take a contiguous range of input samples starting from that point to use in
the PFB. Unlike the MeerKAT FPGA F-engine, this means that every output
spectrum has a common delay for all samples. There will also likely be
differences from the MeerKAT F-engine when there are large discontinuities in
the delay model, as the inversion becomes ambiguous.

The polarisations are allowed to have independent delay models. To accommodate
different coarse delays, the space at the end of each chunk (to which the start
of the following chunk is copied to accommodate the PFB footprint) is expanded,
to ensure that as long as one polarisation's input starts within the chunk
proper, both can be serviced from the extended chunk. This involves a tradeoff
where support for larger differential delays requires more memory and more
bandwidth. The dominant terms of the delay are shared between polarisations,
and the differential delay is expected to be extremely small (tens of
nanoseconds), so this has minimal impact.

The GPU processing is split into a front-end and a back-end: the front-end
consists of just the PFB FIR, while the backend consists of FFT and
post-processing. Because changes in delay affect the ratio of input samples to
output spectra, the front-end and back-end may run at different cadences. We
run the front-end until we've generated enough spectra to fill a back-end
buffer, then run the back-end and push the resulting spectra into a queue for
transmission. It's important to (as far as possible) always run the back-end
on the same amount of data, because cuFFT bakes the number of FFTs into its
plan.

Digitiser sample statistics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The PFB kernel also computes the average power of the incoming signal. Ideally
that would be done by a separate kernel that processed each incoming sample
exactly once. However, doing so would be expensive in memory bandwidth.
Instead, we update statistics as samples are loaded for PFB calculations.

Some care is needed to avoid double-counting due to overlapping PFB windows.
The simplest way to add this to the existing code is that for each output
spectrum, we include the last 2 √ó channels samples from the PFB window. In
steady state operation and in the absence of coarse delay changes, this will
count each sample exactly once. Coarse delay changes will cause some samples
to be counted twice or not at all, but these are sufficiently rare that it is
not likely to affect the statistics.

Average power is updated at the granularity of output chunks. The PFB kernel
updates a total power accumulator stored in the output item. This is performed
using (64-bit) integer arithmetic, as this avoids the pitfalls of
floating-point precision when accumulating a large number of samples.

Network transmit
----------------
The current transmit system is quite simple. By default a single spead2 stream
is created, with one substream per multicast destination. For each output
chunk, memory together with a set of heaps is created in advance. The heaps are
carefully constructed so that they reference numpy arrays (including for the
timestamps), rather than copying data into spead2. This allows heaps to be
recycled for new data without having to create new heap objects.

If the traffic for a single engine exceeds the bandwidth of the network
interface, it is necessary to distribute it over multiple interfaces. In this
case, several spead2 streams are created (one per interface). Each of them has
a substream for every multicast destination, but they are not all used (the
duplication simplifies indexing). When heaps are transmitted, a stream is
selected for each heap to balance the load. Descriptors and stop heaps are
just sent through the first stream for simplicity. This scheme assumes that
all the interfaces are connected to the same network and hence it does not
matter which interface is used other than for load balancing.

PeerDirect
^^^^^^^^^^
When GPUDirect RDMA / PeerDirect is used, the mechanism is altered slightly to
eliminate the copy from the GPU to the host:

1. Chunks no longer own their memory. Instead, they use CUDA device pointers
   referencing the memory stored in an OutItem. As a result, Chunks and
   OutItems are tied tightly together (each OutItem holds a reference to the
   corresponding Chunk), instead of existing on separate queues.

2. Instead of OutItems being returned to the free queue once the data has been
   copied to the host, they are only returned after the data they hold has
   been fully transmitted.

3. More OutItems are allocated to compensate for the increased time required
   before an OutItem can be reused. This has not yet been tuned.

There may be opportunities for further optimisation, in the sense of reducing
the amount of memory that is not actively in use, because some parts of an
OutItem can be recycled sooner than others. Since GPUs that support this
feature tend to have large amounts of memory, this is not seen as a priority.

Output Heap Payload Composition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the case of an 8192-channel array with 64 X-engines, each heap contains 8192/64 =
128 channels. By default, there are 256 time samples per channel. Each sample is
dual-pol complex 8-bit data for a combined sample width of 32 bits or 4 bytes.

The heap payload size in this example is equal to

    channels_per_heap * samples_per_channel * complex_sample_size = 128 * 256 * 4 = 131,072 = 128 KiB.

The payload size defaults to a power of 2, so that packet boundaries in a heap
align with channel boundaries. This isn't important for the :mod:`spead2`
receiver used in the X-engine, but it may be useful for potential third party
consumers of F-engine data.

Missing data handling
---------------------
Inevitably some input data will be lost and this needs to be handled. The
approach taken is that any output heap which is affected by data loss is
instead not transmitted. All the processing prior to transmission happens as
normal, just using bogus data (typically whatever was in the chunk from the
previous time it was used), as this is simpler than trying to make vectorised
code skip over the missing data.

To track the missing data, a series of "present" boolean arrays passes down
the pipeline alongside the data. The first such array is populated by spead2.
From there a number of transformations occur:

1. When copying the head of one chain to append it to the tail of the previous
   one, the same is done with the presence flags.
2. A prefix sum (see :func:`numpy.cumsum`) is computed over the flags of the
   chunk. This allows the number of good packets in any interval to be
   computed quickly.
3. For each output spectrum, the corresponding interval of input heaps is
   computed (per polarisation) to determine whether any are missing, to
   produce per-spectrum presence flags.
4. When an output chunk is ready to be sent, the per-spectrum flags are
   reduced to per-batch flags.

Narrowband
----------
Narrowband outputs are those in which only a portion of the digitised
bandwidth is channelised and output. Typically they have narrower channel
widths. The overall approach is as follows:

1. The signal is multiplied (:dfn:`mixed`) by a complex tone of the form
   :math:`e^{2\pi jft}`, to effect a shift in the frequency of the
   signal. The centre of the desired band is placed at the DC frequency.

2. The signal is convolved with a low-pass filter. This suppresses most
   of the unwanted parts of the band, to the extent possible with a FIR
   filter.

3. The signal is subsampled (every Nth sample is retained), reducing the data
   rate. The low-pass filter above limits aliasing. At this stage, twice as
   much bandwidth as desired is retained.

4. The rest of the pipeline proceeds largely as before, but using double the
   final channel count (since the bandwidth is also doubled, the channel width
   is as desired). The input is now complex rather than real, so the Fourier
   transform is a complex-to-complex rather than real-to-complex transform.

5. Half the channels (the outer half) are discarded.

.. note::
   To avoid confusion, the "subsampling factor" is the ratio of original to
   retained samples in the subsampling step, while the "decimation factor" is
   the factor by which the bandwidth is reduced. Because the mixing turns a
   real signal into a complex signal, the subsampling factor is twice the
   decimation factor in step 3 (but equal to the overall decimation
   factor).

The decimation is thus achieved by a combination of time-domain (steps 2 and
3) and frequency domain (step 5) techniques. This has better computational
efficiency than a purely frequency-domain approach (which would require the
PFB to be run on the full bandwidth), while mitigating many of the filter
design problems inherent in a purely time-domain approach (the roll-off of the
FIR filter can be hidden in the discarded outer channels).

The first three steps are implemented by a "digital down-conversion"
("DDC") kernel. This is applied to each input chunk, after copying the head of
the following chunk to the tail of the chunk. This does lead to redundant
down-conversion in the overlap region, and could potentially be optimised.

The PFB FIR kernel has alternations because it needs to consume
single-precision complex inputs rather than packed integers. However, the real
and imaginary components are independent, and so the input is treated
internally as if it contained just real values, with an adjustment to correctly
index the weights. The postprocessing kernel also has adjustments, as the
corrections for a real-to-complex Fourier transform are no longer required, and
the outer channels must be discarded.

An incidental difference between the wideband and narrowband modes is that in
wideband, the DC frequency of the Fourier transform corresponds to the lowest
on-sky frequency, while for wideband it corresponds to the centre on-sky
frequency. This difference is also handled in the postprocessing kernel.
Internally, channels are numbered according to the Fourier transform (0 being
the DC channel), but different calculations are used in wideband versus
narrowband mode to swap the two halves of the band (and to discard half the
channels) when

- indexing the gains array;
- indexing the output array;
- computing the phase from the fine delay and channel.

.. _ddc:

Down-conversion kernel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For efficiency, the first three operations above are implemented in the same
kernel. In particular, the filtered samples that would be removed by
subsampling are never actually computed.  Unlike the memory-bound PFB kernel,
this kernel is at the boundary between being memory-bound and compute-bound
(depending on the number of taps). The design thus needs a more efficient
approach to decoding the packed samples.

Each work-item is responsible for completely computing :math:`C` consecutive
output values (:math:`C` is a tuning parameter), which it does
concurrently. We can describe the operation with the equation

.. math::

   y_{b+i} = \sum_{k=0}^{T-1} x_{S(b+i)+k} \cdot h_k \cdot e^{2\pi jf[S(b+i)+k]}

where

- :math:`x` is the input
- :math:`y` is the output
- :math:`h` contains the weights
- :math:`S` is the subsampling factor
- :math:`T` is the number of taps
- :math:`b` is the first of the :math:`C` outputs to produce
- :math:`0 \le i < C` is the index into the :math:`C` outputs to produce; and
- :math:`f` is the frequency of the mixer signal, in cycles per digitiser sample.

The first simplification we make is to pre-compute the weights with the mixer
(on the CPU). Let :math:`z_k = h_k e^{2\pi jfk}`. Then the equation
becomes

.. math::

   y_{b+i} = e^{2\pi jfS(b+i)} \sum_{k=0}^{T-1} x_{S(b+i)+k}\cdot z_k.

For now we'll focus on just the summation, and deal with the exponential later.
For simplicity, assume :math:`T` is a multiple of :math:`S` (although the
implementation does not require it) and let :math:`W = \frac{T}{S}`. Then we
can write :math:`k` as :math:`pS + q` and rewrite this equation as

.. math::

   y_{b+i} = e^{2\pi jfS(b+i)} \sum_{p=0}^{W - 1} \sum_{q=0}^{S-1} x_{S(b+i+p) + q} \cdot z_{pS + q}.

The kernel iterates first over :math:`q`, then :math:`p`, then :math:`i`. A
separate accumulator variable is kept for each value of :math:`i`.
For a given :math:`q`, we only need :math:`C + W - 1` different values
of :math:`x` (since that's the range of :math:`i+p`). We decode them all into
an array before iterating over :math:`q` and :math:`i` to update the
accumulators.

When :math:`q` is advanced, we need to decode a new set of :math:`C + W - 1`
samples. These immediately follow the previous set. We take advantage of this:
in many cases, the new sample occupies (at least partially) the same 32-bit
word from which we obtained the previous sample. By keeping those
:math:`C + W - 1` words around, we get a head-start on decoding the new
sample.

Choosing :math:`C` is a trade-off. Larger values of :math:`C` clearly increase
register pressure. However they reduce the number of loads required: each work
item decodes :math:`(C + W - 1)S` samples to produce :math:`C` outputs, which
is an average of :math:`S + \frac{(W - 1)S}{C}`.
To further reduce the global memory traffic, all the samples and weights are
copied to local memory at the start of the kernel. The results are also first
transposed in local memory before being written back to global memory, to
improve the global memory access pattern.

The implementation relies heavily on loop unrolling. Provided that :math:`CS`
samples occupy a whole number of 32-bit words (so that different work-items are
loading samples from the same bit positions within a word), all the conditional
logic involved in decoding the samples can be evaluated at compile-time.

Mixer signal
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Care needs to be taken with the precision of the argument to the mixer signal.
Simply evaluating the sine and cosine of :math:`2\pi ft` when
:math:`t` is large can lead to a catastrophic loss of precision, as the
product :math:`ft` will have a large integer part and leave few bits for
the fractional part. Even passing :math:`f` in single precision can lead
to large errors.

To avoid these problems, fixed-point computations are used. Phase is
represented as a fractional number of cycles, scaled by :math:`2^{32}` and
stored in a 32-bit integer. When performing arithmetic on values encoded this
way, the values may overflow and wrap. The high bits that are lost represent
complete cycles, and so have no effect on phase.

Filter design
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Discarding half the channels after channelisation allows for a lot of freedom
in the design of the DDC FIR filter: the discarded channels, as well as their
aliases, can have an arbitrary response. This allows for a gradual transition
from passband to stopband. We use :func:`scipy.signal.remez` to produce a
filter that is as close as possible to 1 in the passband and 0 in the
stopband. A weighting factor (which the user can override) balances the
priority of the passband (ripple) and stopband (alias suppression).

The filter performance is slightly improved by noting that the discarded
channels have multiple aliases, and the filter response in those aliases is
also irrelevant. We thus use :func:`scipy.signal.remez` to only optimise the
response to those channels that alias into the output.

Delays
^^^^^^
Coarse delay is (as for wideband) implemented using an input offset to the PFB
FIR kernel. This means that the resolution of coarse delay is coarser than for
wideband (by the subsampling factor). This choice is driven by the access
patterns in the various kernels: the DDC kernel depends on knowing at compile
time where each packed sample starts within a word, and hence is not amenable
to single-sample input offsets.

Multiple outputs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A standard use case for MeerKAT is to produce wideband and narrowband outputs
from a single input stream. To make this efficient, a single engine can
support multiple output streams, and the input is only transferred to the GPU
once.

The code is split into an Engine class that handles common input tasks, and a
Pipeline class that handles per-output processing and transmission. Copying
the head of each chunk to the tail of the previous chunk is handled by the
Engine, after which the previous chunk is pushed to the input queue of each
Pipeline. The chunks have reference counts to help determine when all
pipelines are done with them.

Input statistics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The wideband PFB FIR kernel also computes statistics on the input digitiser
stream (just RMS power, at the time of writing). Since all the outputs are
produced from the same input, we do not attempt to duplicate this calculation
for narrowband.

An engine with only narrowband outputs will thus be lacking these statistics.
Calculating the statistics in that case would require extending the DDC kernel
to compute the same statistics.

.. [#]
   Going back to the original definition for the DFT we saw the complex
   exponential :math:`e^{\frac{-2\pi j}{2N}\cdot ik}` has a variable :math:`k`
   where :math:`k` represents the frequency component under computation for the
   input sequence :math:`x_i.` If :math:`k` is reversed (i.e. negative) the
   complex exponential changes to :math:`e^{\frac{2\pi j}{2N}\cdot ik}` as the
   negative in :math:`-k` multiplies out.
