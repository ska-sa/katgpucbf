Qualification framework
===========================================

.. todo::

   This document needs a bit of an introduction distinguishing it from normal
   unit-testing.

   The wording could also be cleaned up somewhat, and the "Requirements" section
   can mention the "optional extras" now included in the setup.

The ``qualification`` folder is intended for use with pytest in order to
run qualification tests on a correlator run using ``katgpucbf``.

A connection is made to an SDP Master Controller, an
appropriately-specced correlator product is requested, interacted with,
and then shut down afterwards. Facilities are provided for the test to
interact with the correlator, both by sending it KATCP requests and by
ingesting the output data.

Requirements
------------

A ``requirements.in`` and ``requirements.txt`` are provided in this
directory, based on ``katgpucbf``\ 's ``requirements-dev.txt``. A
pared-down version of this may become available in future.

While ``katgpucbf`` itself doesn't need to be installed for the test
framework to work, you need to have the appropriate Docker image
available as specified (see below).

The machine running the tests needs to be able to receive data from the
correlator network. The data rate can become quite high for larger array sizes.

Sample pytest.ini
-----------------

I don't want to commit a ``pytest.ini`` for this folder to git, but it's
helpful to have one. You'll need to set it up only once per machine that
you're deploying on, and it'll look something like this:

::

   [pytest]
   asyncio_mode = auto
   master_controller_host = lab5.sdp.kat.ac.za
   master_controller_port = 5001
   product_name = bobs_qualification_correlator  # Use your own name
   interface = enp193s0f0
   use_ibv = true
   log_cli = true
   log_cli_level = info
   addopts = --report-log=report.json

Running
-------

Currently, I use the following command to run the tests contained in
this directory:

::

   spead2_net_raw pytest -v qualification --image-override katgpucbf:harbor.sdp.kat.ac.za/cbf/katgpucbf:latest

Explanation:

-  ``spead2_net_raw`` enables ibverbs usage. For a small correlator,
   this shouldn't really be an issue because the output rates are quite
   low, but for larger ones it will be an issue.
-  ``--image-override`` is designed to work in exactly the same way as
   that in ``sim_correlator.py``, specifying exactly which Docker image
   to use for the tests.

The general pytest options apply, so for instance with ``-x`` you can
stop after the first failed test instead of continuing, etc.

Post-processing
---------------

The steps above produce a ``report.json`` file. To turn that into a usable PDF,
run

::

   qualification/report/generate_pdf.py report.json report.pdf

This requires at least ``texlive-base``, ``texlive-latex-extra`` and
``latexmk``. This step doesn't interact with the live system at all, so it is
possible to copy/mount the JSON file to another machine to run this step.

Some values are taken from the environment (or if present, a ``.env`` fileâ€”see
`python-dotenv`_). In particular, these are
