    Verification method
    -------------------
    Verified by means of a test.

    Group delay is defined as the negative of the derivative of phase shift
    with respect to angular frequency :math:`\omega`. To estimate the
    derivative by finite differences, the dsim is configured with two sine
    waves (one in each polarisation) with a small difference in frequency. The
    difference needs to be carefully selected. If it too small, the effect is
    dominated by quantisation effects. However, the group delay can only be
    determined modulo the period of the beat frequency, and hence the
    frequencies cannot be too far apart.

    Rather than try to pick a single difference, we use two: firstly the
    minimum difference supported by the dsim, to localise the delay, and
    then a much larger difference to refine it.

    Additionally, a phase rate is set in the F-engine delay model. This
    cancels out when measuring phase differences, but ensures that there is
    variation in the phases and thus helps prevent systematic bias in the
    quantisation errors.

    The test is replicated across many channels to increase the number of
    samples and hence improve signal-to-noise. The channels are divided amongst
    the simulated antennas then combined by beamforming, which allows for
    larger amplitudes without saturation in the time domain, and also speeds up
    the test.
