The CBF, when configured to produce the Imaging data product set and Narrowband
Fine resolution channelisation, and receiving UHF- or L-band data, shall digitally
down-convert the sub-bands with a programmable band selection frequency with a
centre frequency resolution of $\le \SI{100}{\hertz}$ across the entire pass band.
