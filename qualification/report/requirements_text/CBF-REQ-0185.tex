The CBF shall apply the delay polynomial, as provided via the CAM
interface, with the following criteria:
\begin{enumerate}
\item range of delay: 0 to $\ge \SI{75}{\micro\second}$.
\item resolution of delay: $\le \SI{2.5}{\pico\second}$.
\item range of rate of change of delay:
$\le \SI{500}{\pico\second\per\second}$ to
$\ge \SI{1.9}{\nano\second\per\second}$.
\item resolution of rate of change of delay:
$\le \SI{2.5}{\pico\second\per\second}$.
\end{enumerate}
