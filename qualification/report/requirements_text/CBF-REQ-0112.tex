The CBF shall apply the phase polynomial, as provided via the
CAM interface, with the following criteria:
\begin{enumerate}
\item range of fringe phase: $\SI[parse-numbers=false]{-\pi}{\radian}$ to
$\SI[parse-numbers=false]{\pi}{\radian}$ ($\ang{-180}$ to $\ang{+180}$)
\item resolution of fringe phase: less than or equal to $\SI{0.01}{\radian}$
($\ang{0.57}$)
\item range of rate of change of fringe phase: $\le
\SI{-49.22}{\radian\per\second}$ to $\ge \SI{49.22}{\radian\per\second}$
(\SI{7.83}{\hertz})
\item resolution of rate of change of fringe phase: less than or equal to
\SI{0.044}{\radian\per\second}
\end{enumerate}
