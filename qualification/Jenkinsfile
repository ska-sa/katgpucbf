/* This file tells Jenkins how to execute the qualification tests for this repo.
 * Everything runs in docker containers, so in theory any Jenkins server should
 * be able to parse this file, however the pytest-jenkins.ini file needs to be
 * configured for the hardware it is running on. The Docker Engine being used needs
 * to have been configured to use the NVIDIA Container Runtime and the node which the
 * container runs on needs the NVIDIA OFED driver installed.
 *
 * Additionally the Jenkins server also needs access to an NVIDIA NIC that
 * supports ibverbs. The ibverbs drivers need to be passed into the Jenkins
 * container using specific flags.
 *
 * For more information on the qualification framework, see katgpucbf/doc/qualification.rst
