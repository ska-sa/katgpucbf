The only things in __all__ are Stopped and Empty. Why?

- In `process.py` you wait for items' events in unexpected places - after you pull something off the `in_free_queue` for example. We'd expect everything to be finished there, since it's on the "free" queue. Is this a "just in case" thing? Or is there some purpose that I haven't understood?

extra samples - taps*channels*2 - 8. I wasn't able to figure out why -8 specifically.

types.py is also something of a mystery. Why weren't the types from katsdpsigproc just used?

decode.mako doesn't seem to be used at all. (I'd guess it came before it was figured out that it's faster to load and convert dynamically.)

pfb-fir function `get_sample_10bit()` can probably be optimised with some kind of coalesced read.

pybind11 `py_send.cpp` for the `sender` class, you use little lambdas instead of just calling the member functions directly. Why?
